Buxton School Goes Light,https://medium.com/the-light-phone/buxton-school-goes-light-9ab46f290a7b?source=topics_v2---------0-84--------------------412e776e_824f_4ec7_92f1_dbcf8e7660d7-------17,"Published inThe Light PhoneLightFollowDec 13·3 min readBuxton School Goes Light“From the start we thought it would be a good idea for this community to not have smartphones, but for a long time we thought it wasn’t something you could do. That is until last year, we reached a tipping point in terms of how heartfelt our conviction was that this would be a better way to live and learn together.”— Peter Beck, Head of School at BuxtonStudents at Buxton decorated their Light Phone cases.In the spring of 2022, Peter Beck reached out to Light asking if we had any interest in collaborating with them as they transitioned to a school-wide smartphone ban for students & faculty. We have always wondered what it might look like for a whole school or community to go light collectively, and were quite excited by the idea.Buxton School is located in the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts.Coming into the new school year, we shared around 80 phones with everyone learning and working at Buxton. Students set up their Light Phones at orientation and were asked to fill out a short survey about their previous smartphone usage. A week later Peter wrote us:I know our teams are working together to collect more quantitative or detailed info, but I wanted to reach out to you directly about the first week. It’s incredible. Watching people make new friends, play together outside, say hi to each other as they pass on the path — it’s unreal what a difference this change has made. If what I’m seeing at Buxton is any indication, I hope more communities adopt light phones or similar technologies en masse. It’s great to see, and great to be a part of.By mid-October, things still seemed to be going well, and so we planned a trip to interview students and faculty about the experience:Buxton School Goes Light Interview VideoIt’s one thing when a smartphone user decides to take the plunge and buy themselves a Light Phone, but it’s much different when it’s forced upon you by a parent or school. There was some pretty strong pushback from students when the idea was first announced. There was also some friction with the phone itself, with students complaining about the slower speed of texting or lack of particular features. However, it does seem to have had positive benefits all around, especially when talking with teachers about changes in their demeanor and performance. At Buxton, meal time is always communal, and that is one of the places where the positive effects of the smartphone ban are most obvious.Teachers acknowledged that although they are no longer competing with smartphones, students can still struggle with the attention spans required for the school work. This is not an entirely new problem either.While most students told us they intended to return to their smartphones after the Buxton school year, they still acknowledged the benefits of not having smartphones while on campus. Some said they could see themselves using a Light Phone at times for focusing in college, and a few students even seemed keen to keep using a Light Phone as their only phone beyond Buxton.Buxton does not have any plans to bring back smartphones to campus. The conversations that this experiment brings up around smartphones and students is a timely one. It has gathered press coverage (WSJ, November 20) as well as other interested schools reaching out about collaborations.We look forward to sharing more updates on this experience in the future!—P.S. If your school or organization is interested in learning more about a potential collaboration — please reach out info@thelightphone.com.----More from The Light PhoneDesigned to be used as little as possible.Read more from The Light PhoneAboutHelpTermsPrivacyGet the Medium appGet unlimited accessLight2.2K Followerswww.thelightphone.comFollowHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Is it life? or Creating a character in the video game?I love technical innovations and I often feel fascinated, when I understand an innovation or idea. I had mixed feelings when I heard about Neuralink for the first time. I discussed it in my blog related to Neuralink.For the first time, I felt terrified by watching this Ectolife concept. Hashem Al-Ghaili is the man behind this concept.As explained in the video, this concept can solve the problems of Surrogacy and infertility issues. Yes, it might sound great for those, who faced those issues but I believe that there will be a lot of differences between machine-reproduced babies and human-reproduced babies.The reproduction system is a part of living things’ lifecycle. When speaking particularly about humans, few of them might face problems related to the reproduction system, whereas others might face issues with different organs in the body (which is quite common and acceptable) because, as far as I know, there isn’t a perfect human being exist till date (with not even a small problem related to health in his/her lifetime).The entire concept is a concern for me, but in specific, I would discuss a couple of aspects, in which I am more concerned.Every growth pod features sensors that can monitor the baby’s vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, breathing rate, and oxygen saturationEctolife growth pod features internal speakersConcern: What about the RADIATION effect? most of the sensors cause at least a slight effect of radiation. Wouldn’t there be any effect of SOUND WAVES and ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES (which are responsible for sound waves)?Genetically engineering the embryo before implanting it into artificial wombs?Concern: This is the biggest concern I have. I believe every one of us is unique in this world because of our genes, which are inherited from our ancestors. Now, if we have the power of altering the genes of a person — choosing the height, weight, physical structure, skin tone, etc. Are we creating a character in a video game? — If everyone alters their genes and can become strongest and fair, then isn’t it a cause for war to kill others to survive in the competition and only one exists (to become unique)?I don’t back Ectolife at any cost, even if there are a couple of positive aspects like fixing inherited genetic diseases and as an alternative for couples with infertility issues. I can’t imagine a world where Ectolife and Neuralink combine with no regulation exists around. It becomes a disastrous world to live in and I wouldn’t wish to be in such a place, where these two concepts become reality and function as they want.----5More from Innovations in Technology and HealthcareThis publication aims to present you with the most recent and noteworthy innovations and research, which have the power to disrupt the future.Read more from Innovations in Technology and HealthcareRecommended from MediumAnna (she/her)inThe MotherloadHow I Easily Made Our Home Into Our Teens’ Hang-out HouseKrista RosenWe now know how traumatic experiences impact us on a physical level.Anna NelsonThe Sad Truth About FosteringLyn LomasiUsing Creativity to Lose Post-Pregnancy Baby WeightAngelia LawrenceApparently, I’m a Prejudiced B*#@€!Justin HarlaninCinapseSESAME STREET Remains Crucially Relevant in 2017: Meet Alex and JuliaSammy AdlerBarely staying afloat: Single Parenting through COVID-19MansBoostIqReviews Eufy Robovac 11S MAXAboutHelpTermsPrivacyGet the Medium appGet unlimited accessChamanth mvs59 FollowersData Science and ML practitioner | Blogging on medium on technology and self-thoughts | https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamanth-mvs-9a59a4131/FollowHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
Engineering Principles at Kingfisher,https://medium.com/kingfisher-technology/engineering-principles-at-kingfisher-fbe219da5fdc?source=topics_v2---------2-84--------------------412e776e_824f_4ec7_92f1_dbcf8e7660d7-------17,"Published inKingfisher-TechnologyStu CoeFollowDec 13·5 min readEngineering Principles at KingfisherPhoto by Tyler Lastovich: https://www.pexels.com/photo/green-leafed-trees-572688/Software engineering can be a complex subject. It certainly is for Enterprises and it’s no secret that it can quickly become highly complex.It doesn’t take much: one more integration requirement, automating away a tricky bit of toil, catering for just one more harmless little business requirement… It soon mounts up.And that’s just the software itself. What about everything we like/want/need to wrap around an application? The SDLC offers a plethora of complexities to overcome and, sometimes, it can all feel a little overwhelming.Illustrative breakdown of team organisationHere at Kingfisher, we currently have in excess of 60 scrum teams and ~1100 engineers all contributing to our “Digital estate” and, in addition to that, we are progressing through a Dev(Sec)Ops transformation. Sometimes, I’ll be honest, it feels like we’re on an exponential complexity growth curve.Don’t get me wrong, Kingfisher is most certainly not alone in this — looking around us, we see this is a common fact — the nature of the beast, if you will, and our experience and training (and Twitter) tells us it is so. This is a big part of what makes a career in software engineering so exciting. But what are we doing to temper this complexity?BackgroundAs my first post here, I thought it might be useful to provide some context and insight into Kingfisher’s Digital division.We are currently running four main programmes of work, each one containing a number of “domain teams” (you’d hear the term Product team too but more on that in a later post) providing solutions for their given business domain. Not to mention the teams and systems underpinning all of this business capability. Each domain team is then split into a number of feature teams. At the domain level, there is a governance layer: each domain should have as a minimum:a Product Manager,a Tech Lead anda Delivery Leadand these roles are helping to bring alignment to our feature teams with our overall strategy and direction.But there is, as you will know being the well-read professional you are, a lot lot more to it than adding a single layer of governance.Embarking on our “Digital transformation” several years ago allowed for and bred disparate team growth, more or less promoted a lack of central governance and instead favoured programme autonomy in order to achieve high enough delivery velocity. This worked well and we have achieved an awful lot but we inevitably accrued a lot of (various forms of) debt along the way and at a point in time it all started to slow down again.EvolutionOne of the most recent solutions to tackling our complexity at scale was to put a new role in place — the Principal Software Engineer — of which I am one.This, again, is not a new or unique solution. It doesn’t take much to discover this is fast becoming (if it isn’t already) a fairly ubiquitous industry role. For us, a PSE sits at the programme level, alongside our Programme Managers and Product leadership. Our role, essentially, is to bring about and maintain a level of consistency within and across our programmes and help define our future direction more cohesively.One of the first activities we felt it was prudent to conduct was to define our principles to help drive desired behaviours and provide a consistent framework for our department to follow as a whole.The first version of our principles is now “live” and we are working together to shape our decision making based upon them. They are the first and most fundamental step for our teams to align against, helping to create a common vocabulary and to help steer our roadmap.The principles themselves are not designed to be revolutionary or controversial. Rather, they reflect a collection of proven best practices, either well established or relatively new. As such, they are both aspirational and a reflection of current activities.It is also true that they are fairly high in number — 30! — and this a fact we were aware of early on in the formulation process. Ultimately, we settled upon the fact that as a starting point it was better to provide more detail than less. What we’re not wanting to do is “boil the ocean” though a detractor could easily cast that aspersion. Rather they reflect the acknowledgment, and my opening assertion, that software engineering is complex and also that all of our teams are, to varying degrees, siloed from each other and so priorities and focus inevitably differ.We envisage and hope that over time these principles will change and diminish in number as some of them devolve into our teams’ shared ways of working and natural behaviours.The next decision we made was to categorise our principles into four logical groupings:OrganisationalAs a department, Engineering has an obligation to follow and apply our IT strategy. Our Organisational principles should both feed and feed from our Architectural Principles, providing a foundation for our Operational and Implementational Principles.ArchitecturalUltimately, Engineering are aligned with our organisation’s architectural principles but, here, we call out some of those principles that carry pertinence.OperationalLed by our organisational and architectural principles, we must ensure we are well equipped to respond quickly to customer and market demands and are offering our customers a reliable experience whilst ensuring we are running in an economical fashion to reduce our impact on both company costs and the natural environment.Implementational (I’m pretty sure this is a real word?)Building, in turn, on the organisational and architectural principles, how we author and compose our applications must ensure we are delivering quality software solutions at the pace our business requires.This made sense to us as we are trying to bring unity across the department and, thus, we must face into each aspect of the work we are and will be doing.We then found we could group each category’s principles to help call out key themes to help highlight why we’ve set each principle.Finally, to help our teams understand the purpose and benefits of each principle, we have taken inspiration from TOGAF and provided a statement and rationale for each.Our principles then, without the gory details of our rationales:Infographic of our engineering principlesI appreciate an image with so much embedded text is not accessible to all and I apologise for that.We hope these principles provide our teams with a solid foundation upon which they can flourish, and we can support our DIY brands across the UK, Ireland, France, Poland, Romania, Spain and Portugal effectively and help set them up for continuing success.If you are interested in joining us on our journey, please do check out our careers page.Thanks for reading!----More from Kingfisher-TechnologyOur very own DIY project, bringing you stories from our talented team of technology experts who are transforming our industry.
